Helpers are classes that are not part of the core system but can greatly improve it by adding new features and possibilities.

This section documents the included helpers and how to use them. Since helpers are classes they can be added to the framework by placing them inside the helpers folder or in sub folders.

All helpers will have a namespace of Helpers if they are in a folder the folder name will be added to that namespace like namespace \\Helpers\\PhpMailer;.
